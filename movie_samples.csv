Buddy's unorthodox approach to therapy is confrontational and abrasive and Dave is bewildered by it. Then, after yet another mishap, Judge Daniels orders Dave to step up his therapy or wind up in jail. So, Buddy moves in with Dave to help him battle his inner demons. Buddy himself has no inner demons since he acts out at every opportunity and that includes making lewd comments about Dave's girlfriend Linda and goading Dave into confronting every slight, past or present, head-on. But Buddy finally goes too far and Dave must decide whether to crawl back into his shell or stand up for himself. Could it be that Buddy's confounding and contradictory treatment is just what the doctor ordered?",0,/wsrZrb2Ng3eO4TYmeBufwdKeC3a.jpg,135645823,Feel the Love.,5,239,305224,9506,2015-04-22 18:07:37 UTC,2015-04-22 20:12:27 UTC,2 wins & 5 nominations.,52,6,Adam Sandler,Jack Nicholson,Marisa Tomei,Luis Guzmán,Peter Segal,David Dorfman,NA,80.86109733333333,Comedy,NA,Columbia Pictures,Happy Madison Productions,English,NA,United States of America,NA

She vows (against all logic) to build a new palace for Caesar within three months. Since all her architects are either busy otherwise or too conservative in style, this ambivalent honor falls to Edifis. He is to build the palace and be covered in gold or, if not, his fate is to be eaten by crocodiles. Edifis calls upon an old friend to help him out: The fabulous Druid Getafix from Gaul, who brews a fantastic potion that gives supernatural strength. In order to help and protect the old Druid, Asterix and Obelix accompany him on his journey to Egypt. When Julius Caesar gets wind of the project succeeding, he has the building site attacked by his troops in order to win the bet and not lose face. But just like the local pirates, he hasn't counted on Asterix and Obelix.",1,/qWy5b64SoBXcMDdfgLyLZgIHSdv.jpg,111127553,"",7,117,250223,2899,2015-04-22 18:08:01 UTC,2015-04-22 21:05:19 UTC,1 win & 4 nominations.,0,6,Gérard Depardieu,Christian Clavier,Jamel Debbouze,Monica Bellucci,Alain Chabat,René Goscinny ,Albert Uderzo ,0.0,Adventure,Comedy,Canal+,NA,Français,Deutsch,France,Germany
